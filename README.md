[![Build Status](https://github.com/davidperrenoud/Gamegirl.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/davidperrenoud/Gamegirl) [![Coverage Status](https://github.com/davidperrenoud/Gamegirl/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/davidperrenoud/Gamegirl?branch=master)

The most portable way to play LÖVE, PICO-8, Scratch or your favorite emulated games. Powered by RetroArch!

## Description

Goals:

* Hardware accelerated display!
* Custom software (Lakka / RetroArch)
* High quality case and buttons
* Small form factor

A very affordable portable console will be made using a 120 FPS 320x240 display and a Raspberry Pi Zero. It will be thin and tiny: only 66 mm x 99 mm!

The Lakka distribution powered by RetroArch will be used because of its speed, its fast power-on and instant power-off and its potential to run many retro and hipster-retro games (LÖVE, PICO-8, Scratch and emulators).

[Jean-André] from France is the software guy of this project. He is the main Lakka developer and a top 5 RetroArch contributor. [David] from Switzerland is the hardware guy.
